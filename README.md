# Dashtoon_Webapp
Hello, I created this app in Python using the Qt5 framework. I utilized this framework's designer app to construct an app with an input field for the user to type his thoughts. Then he must click the generate button to generate the image. This is now generated by the api you gave. As previously stated, when the initial call is made, we have a lag between the response. This was a little difficult to handle in Qt5. However, I used Threading to complete this operation. I did my best to complete this assignment within the time span provided. I'd want to thank Dashtoon for allowing me to tap into my creative side for this project.
