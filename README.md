# Dashtoon_Webapp

Hello! Welcome to Dashtoon_Webapp Project, a Python application built with the Qt5 framework. This application allows users to express their thoughts and generate corresponding images through an integrated API.

## Features

- Input field for users to let loose their imagination.
- "Create" button to create images based on user input.
- "Next Page" button to move to next page for next panel creation.
- Tab feature for seamless navigation between pages.
- Shareable executable file which can be used across windows devices.

## API Integration

The application leverages an API to dynamically generate images. Threading has been implemented to handle the lag between the initial API call and the response, ensuring a responsive user experience.

## Usage

1. [Executable file can be downloaded from this link ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vamr39Wm0jvTAbwsWI5tVkSg8nrA6ZzK?usp=sharing)
2. Can be used across different devices(laptop/desktop) upon sharing the executable.

## Instructions for using the Executable

1. You need to download the executable file zip version.
2. Extract the content and open the "dist" folder.
3. Inside it you have to open the App folder and search for "App.exe".
4. Click on it and you are ready to go.

## Acknowledgments

I want to express my gratitude to Dashtoon for providing the opportunity to unleash my creativity through this project.

## Challenges and Reflection

- **Lag Handling:** Addressed the lag during API calls using threading.
- **Executable:** Successfully converted the application into an executable.
- **Hosting:** Faced challenges in hosting the application, particularly within the Qt5 context.
- **Improvement Reflection:** Recognized the potential for improvement, particularly in spending more time on the text generation part and the lag faced while getting the first image.
- **Fetching Image for API:** Sometimes the API does not respond and we have to wait for longer duration of time. I was not able to handle this properly but this can be improved upon.
