# Dashtoon_Webapp

Hello! Welcome to Dashtoon_Webapp Project, a Python application built with the Qt5 framework. This application allows users to express their thoughts and generate corresponding images through an integrated API.

## Features

- Input field for users to let loose their imagination.
- "Create" button to create images based on user input.
- "Next Page" button to move to next page for next panel creation.
- Tab feature for seamless navigation between pages.
- Shareable executable file which can be used across windows devices.

## API Integration

The application leverages an API to dynamically generate images. Threading has been implemented to handle the lag between the initial API call and the response, ensuring a responsive user experience.

## Usage

1. Executable can be downloaded by cloning this repository.
2. Can be used across different devices(laptop/desktop) upon sharing the executable.

## Acknowledgments

I want to express my gratitude to Dashtoon for providing the opportunity to unleash my creativity through this project.

## Challenges and Reflection

- **Lag Handling:** Addressed the lag during API calls using threading.
- **Executable:** Successfully converted the application into an executable.
- **Hosting:** Faced challenges in hosting the application, particularly within the Qt5 context.
- **Improvement Reflection:** Recognized the potential for improvement, particularly in spending more time on the text generation part and the lag faced while getting the first image.
